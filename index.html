            <p>Hi, my name is Joshua Kuschner, and this website contains a description
                 of who I am as a programmer and as a person.
                 If you want some more detail, check out my other
                  <a href="https://jkuschner.dev">website</a>.

            <h2>Programming</h2>

            <p>I initally began my programming adventure in high school when I took 
                AP Computer Science. We did all of our progamming in <em>Java</em> for that class, 
                and the only thing we did whole year was solve coding puzzles. 
                Since it was an intro level class, I thought that it was pretty easy. 
                Also, since it was my only exposure to computer science, 
                I naturally thought that all of it was going to be easy.</p>

                <p>There is no greater danger than underestimating your opponent.</p>

            <p>Since then, I have tackled a few more challenging programming projects,
                so I have a better sense of what it takes to be a programmer. Here is a list
                of some projects I have worked on ranked based on difficulty:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Huffman encoder/decoder for files containing ASCII characters</li>
                <li>Bayes classifier that uses Quadratic Discriminant Analysis to classify benign/malignant tumors</li>
                <li>Create and design a website to detail my professional and personal endeavors</li>
            </ol>

                <h3>Some other stuff about me</h3>
            </header>

            <p>Outside of programming, I have a few other hobbies:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cooking</li>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>Board Games</li>
                <li>Cat Care</li>
                <li>Tennis</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Also, my favorite animal is the Giant Panda</p>
